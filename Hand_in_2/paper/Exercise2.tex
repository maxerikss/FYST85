\section*{Exercise 2.72}
\paragraph{Problem:} \textbf{(Bloch sphere for mixed states)} The Bloch sphere picture for pure states of a single qubit was introduced in Section 1.2. This description has an important generalization to mixed states as follows.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Show that an arbitrary density matrix for a mixed state qubit may be written as 
        \begin{equation}
            \rho = \frac{\I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
        \end{equation}
    where $\vec{r}$Â is ta real three-dimensional vector such that $\norm{\vec{r}} \leq 1$. This vector is known as the \textit{Bloch vector} for the state $\rho$.
    \item What is the Bloch vector representation for the state $\rho = \I / 2$?
    \item Show that a state $\rho$ is pure if and only if $\norm{\vec{r}} = 1$.
    \item Show that for pure states the description of the Bloch vectors we have given coincides with that in Section 1.2.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Solution:}
