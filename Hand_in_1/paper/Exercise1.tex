\section{First Exercise}
\paragraph{Problem:} Consider the following two-qubit state:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{1}{2} \ket{00} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{10} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{11}
\end{equation*}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item Show that the state is normalized.
    \item If you make a measurement on the first qubit and obtain the result $\ket{0}$, what is now the two-qubit state after this measurement?
    \item Suppose that you instead obtained the result $\ket{1}$, what is now the two-qubit state after this measurement? (Remember to answer as a normalized state)
    \item Is the original state an entangled state?
\end{enumerate}
